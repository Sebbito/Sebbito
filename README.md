## Hello there 👋

I'm an undergrad from Germany. Always interested to learn and build new things and make them well.

I have a chronic distaste against dynamic languages and enjoy simple and efficient things that give you a lot of freedom.

You can also find more my stuff on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/Sebito).
